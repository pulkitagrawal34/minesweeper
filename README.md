# Minesweeper
Minesweeper grid logic using  python 
This program asks for 3 inputs  
* List of bomb locations -> list of bombs
* No of columns in the field
* No of rows in the field  
Below is an example of sample inputs:

```text
List of bombs: [[0,0],[0,1]]
No. of columns: 4
No. of rows: 3
```

Output will look like this:
```text
[-1, -1, 1, 0]
[2, 2, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
```
This will also give you the time taken by the interpreter to execute the code. Try using higher column and row values to observe the difference.
